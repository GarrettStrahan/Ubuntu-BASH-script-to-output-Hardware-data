# Ubuntu-BASH-script-to-output-Hardware-data
#Put this onto a USB and it will output the data onto this drive
#This works with HP + Dell servers to get important data for an RMA process or if your about to send important server hardware to verify the hardware worked before you shipped it out.
#Works with Ubuntu, even the with the Ubuntu version that is loaded into memory, no installation package needed. Just load the Ubuntu into memory and run this BASH script into the memory with a USB stick. It will put the data back into the USB with the results.
